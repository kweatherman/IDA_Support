## IDA Pro Plugin Support Libraries

By Kevin Weatherman, Updated 2026 for IDA 9.2, [Github](https://github.com/kweatherman/IDA_Support)

#### Utility and support libraries for IDA Pro C/C++ plugins.


* **Utility**: *Utility.h* & *Utility.cpp*, common utility support needed for my plugins. String format, time stamp, exception, platform, etc., support.

------

* **IDA_OggPlayer:** Ogg Vorbis audio file format player from memory I use to indicate a long running plugin completion.  
                                                          A wrapper around Sean Barrett's excellent minimalist [stb_vorbis](http://nothings.org/stb_vorbis/). Allows embedding of audio files that are smaller in size from compression vs raw WAV files. 
							  
------
* **IDA_SegmentSelect:** Custom segment select widget. To solve the problem where the IDA SDK [ask_seg()](https://cpp.docs.hex-rays.com/kernwin_8hpp.html#ac70e33ed6d6d79d08a8f925a182a02e8) function only allows for a single selection, where this one allows multiple selections that returns a list.

##### Example

* **IDA_WaitEx:** Custom wait box widget. A replacement for the default IDA API [show_wait_box()](https://cpp.docs.hex-rays.com/kernwin_8hpp.html#a325acb9c1c1713846df9797e2a1364a3) that solves a lot of issues of it, like lacking any kind of progress feedback, unable to minimize IDA while the wait box is, up, etc. Plus facilitates some extra UI pizzazz vs the default generic looking widget.

##### Examples

### Using

For any or all of the library projects, add the "include" folder, the single header file and the "lib" folder to your Visual Studio 2022 IDA Pro 9 plugin project. Some example projects and/or see usage in some of my plugin projects for usage examples.   
You don't need to install the Qt development environment just to use the libraries since they are prebuilt and the IDA SDK already includes the necessary Qt libraries.

------

### Building

*IDA_OggPlayer* has no other dependencies other than the IDA SDK headers and libs. While the others will require a Qt development environment
if you wish to modify/build them.

* Built using Visual Studio 2022.
* Qt version 6.8.3, which is close enough to IDA's version since we use the IDA's SDK import libs and only extra headers from the Qt includes folder. 
  Note: All that is needed when installing Qt is the "Qt Design Studio" for editing widgets/dialogs, "Qt Creator", and the "Qt Tools Extension" for VS2022. And note for VS2022 you'll probably need to get the extension from the VS marketplace.

T*he projects look for a "$(IDADIR)" environment variable to find the IDA SDK. For me it's always* "_IDADIR=C:\Tools\IDA" since I typically install the SDK into where I install IDA as an "idasdk" folder.
